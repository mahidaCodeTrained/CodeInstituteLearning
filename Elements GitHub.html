<!--These are the first three elements and are the core elements in any HTML program.-->

<img> <!--This is the image element. This allows images to be displayed on web browsers.
          commonly used with the src and alt attributes.-->


<a> <!--The anchor element <a> allows for the use of clickable links on a webpage.
    There are two types of anchor <internal> and <external> for links.
        this is commonly used with the href and target attributes. -->
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="help">Stack Overflow</a>

        <!--This example above is of an external link. External links provide a link to another website page; this can be a link to another page on the same website
             or a link to another site. 
        External links can also be used to download files.-->

        <a href="#next-section">Jump to section on the same page</a>

        <!--^ This showcases a internal link which is a link that is meant to redirect you to the page you're already on. 
              It is designed to redirect you using an id attribute to a section of the page.-->

   
              
              <ol>   <!--The list elements both <ol> and <ul> are elements used in HTML to create lists either ordered with numetrical values such as 
                  one, two and three. Ordered lists are important because they add weight and importance to a set of rules such as a cooking recipe.-->
                   
              <ul>  <!--However, unorded lists work with bullet points as it doesnt stress the value of order like a <li> does. A <ul> will then use bulletpoints
                  as the order in which the bulletpoints are in don't matter as there isnt any stress of importance layed on. -->

                  <!--These <ol> is defined using the <li> element which is it's child element.-->

          <!--To call upon an unordered list is the exact same. You would just have to call
              upon the <ul> element and have it's child the <li> element nested within.-->

              <!--It is important to note that both ordered and unordered list can be nested within one another. -->

    <table> <!--This is another element that has many child elements nested within it such as <tr> for table row, <th> for table heading
      and <td> for table data where you add the entries. These are all nested within <table>. -->

      <tr> <!--Is nested within --> <table>. <th> <!--and--> <td> <!--are nested within --> <tr>


    <form> <!--The form element has many uses such as login and registration to secure webistes. 
    live chat, buying products online, or filling out an online survey. 
    
    You will see common elements that are nested inside a <form> such as the self closing <input> element. -->

  <form> 
<input type="text">  <!--This creates a text box to enter information such as an email. -->
</form>
    
<form>
<input type="submit"> <!--This creates a submit box on the webpage. -->
</form>

<!--It is important to note about form attributes. Form attributes allow the form data to know where it is meant to be going.
To specify the form data then you have to use an "action" attribute and to specify the data delivery method using a "method" attribute. -->

<form action="https://submitgoeshere.com" method="POST">
  <input type="text">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<!--The POST method is used when you need to update data in a database, for example, when a user submits a feedback form.
 The form would need method="POST" on it so that this data is put into the database.

The GET method fetches existing data from the database but does not add the data in the form to the database. 
You might use this method on a login form, which would be part of the code to check if the username value provided by a user matches an entry in the database. 
When you use this method, the form element needs method="GET" on it.--> 

<!--The <form> element with their type attributes contain main different ones to collect different types of data.
  A type="text" attribute provides a text input field and accepts any letters, numbers and special characters from the keyboard as it's content.
A type="submit" attribute creates a button to submit the form.
A type="radio" attribute creates a radio button for a user to click.
A type="checkbox" attribute creates a checkbox for a user to select.
A type="password" attribute creates a text box and replaces any characters entered into it with *.
A type="date" attribute creates an input field that shows a date-picker when clicked. -->

<label> <!--The label element in HTML gives forms a context behind it. It allows the user to recognise what the input field wants.
It has a "for" attribute to correspond to an id. The example is below. -->
<label for="name">Name</label>
<input id="name" type="text">

<!--Input fields determine the data that the form requires you to put in. -->
<!-- More information ^ will be found on the Attributes page of this codespace. -->

<!--Another form component is "checkbox" which allows you to select/deselect options on a form through a checkbox. 
<radio> is another which only allows you to select one option out of many in a checkbox. -->
<form>

<label for="red">Red</label
<input type="radio" id="red" value="red" name="color">

<label for="green">Green</label>
<input type="radio" id="green" value="green" name="color">

<label for="blue">Blue</label>
<input type="radio" id="blue" value="blue" name="color">

<label for="black">Black</label>
<input type="radio" id="black" value="black" name="color">

<label for="pink">Pink</label>
<input type="radio" id=pink value="pink" name="color">

</form>
<!--This gives you the radio box input type which allows to select one of many different checkboxes.
This particular example above ^ showcases a radio type form for color it is imporant to note that 
this input type is not the only input type that can give you multiple options, there is also a <dropdown> type that is within
  the confines of the <form> element. -->

 < "<select>" element. > <!--The select componenet allows you to create dropdown menus to click
                          on a wide variety of different options. This is used for example when 
                          you fill in your nationality in a form. -->

<option> <!--This element displays the option text and can have an optional value that is a unique identifier
              to that option. Each <option> element contains a single choice. -->

 <datalist> <!-- This is another element that is found within forms and it works in combination with 
                 the input element. <datalist> provides the user with suggested options/possible options to choose from.   
                  This can be seen in Google and other browsers that give you suggested searches. -->

  <fieldset> <legend> <!-- The fieldset and legend element are new forms introduced by HTML5. 
                           These elements group related elements together. The <legend> element 
                            follows the fieldset element and gives its content a title. -->

<img> <!--We've already talked about the <img> element earlier in this codespace. However, we will go further in depth now.
The img element is a self closing element therefore doesn't need a closing tag.
-->
<picture> <!--This element is far more detailed than the img element. This <picture> element allows you to show different pictures depending
  on the width of your browser viewport. This is responsive design. The picture will change depending on if you see it on desktop windows or a mobile screen.-->
  <!-- Add your picture element here -->

<iframe> <!--This is another element that is a means of embedding live content from another web site into a web document.
it uses the url of an external website to embed the site's content locally in the document.
The essential attribute with this element is the src attribute. The width and height attribute also go along with this.-->

<audio> <!--This element is used to embed sound into a html document. The source of the audio that is previewed onto the webpage will be 
defined using the src attribute. 
However, there are more attributes that can be used with the <audio> element. A key attribute is "controls" which gives the user
  playback options and volume control options. The "loop" attribute allows the video to be played over again once it's finished.
  The "mute" attribute allows the video to be muted when it's first played, example down below-->
  <audio src="myAudio.mp3" controls muted loop></audio>
  <!--The audio element often has a <source> element and a <track> element nested within it. -->

  <video> <!--The video element is used to embed video on a web page. The main attribute is the "src" attribute.
  The video element however, can take several different attributes depending on the behaviour you want it to have
such as the "autoplay" "loop" "muted" attributes and "width" and "height"-->
