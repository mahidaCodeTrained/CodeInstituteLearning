<a> <!--The anchor element <a> allows for the use of clickable links on a webpage.
    There are two types of anchor <internal> and <external> for links.
        this is commonly used with the href and target attributes. -->

        <!--This example above is of an external link. External links provide a link to another website page; this can be a link to another page on the same website
             or a link to another site. 
        External links can also be used to download files.-->
