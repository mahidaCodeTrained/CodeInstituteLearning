<!--Attributes are extra pieces of code that are assigned to elements such as <p> or <a> (anchor) or <h1> for headings. 
    Attributes allow code to have extra customizable properties beyond the standard ones they already have.
    Attributes in addition, have values assigned to them. For exmaple the attribute of height would have a value assigned to it with an = sign "50" -->
  
    <!--For example check below.-->

<h1 height= "50";> 
    <br>
  <source>  <!--The src (source) attribute is an attritube that is widely used alongside the <img> element. 
    src allows the image to be displayed as it provides the link to the image-->

<alt> <!--The alt (alternative) attribute is used alongside the img element aswell. It provides images a text display if the image doesn't load.
It can also describe the image for visually impaired users browsing your webpage.-->

<href> <!--This attribute provides a link to another page and commonly goes with the <a> element an example will be below
           href stands for hyperlink reference.-->
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

  <!--Attributes as we can see with the descriptions ^ change the behaviour of elements and give the webpage a look that feels more alive.-->

  <!--One of the most common used attributes in all of HTML is the class attribute. 
  The class attribute allows elements to be semantically put together. It is used mostly in stylesheets with CSS and Javascript
  and the elements that are grouped together using this class attribute will share similar styles.
-->
<!--EXAMPLE BELOW-->
<h1 class="orange-background white-text">We can include as many class names as we want</h1>
	
<p class="orange-background">This Paragraph can reuse any or all of the heading's classes</p> <!--These class names are created in a seperate file most of the time.-->

<!--class attributes allow you to add colors, backgrounds and borders to a specific element like a <div> that divides certain areas of a webpage. The class attribute
  would allow the area that is covered by the div to be a certain color for example violet. (This is done with CSS)-->

<id> <!--The id attribute is another that is widely used in HTML, the difference between a class and an id attribute 
is that a class attribute can be used multiple times whereas, a id attribute is unique-->
<!--THERE SHOULD EVER ONLY BE ONE ELEMENT USED WITH A UNIQUE ID ATTRIBUTE-->
 <h2 class=""red-text" id="blue text"> I'm blue!</h2>
 
 <!--^ the class is a classification of the elements but calling upon the id attribute will give that specific code a blue colour
despite the class being red -->

<target> <!--This attribute that is used on links most commonly allows for the link that is clicked to be opened on a new webpage
when used with target="_blank". This is essential to be added otherwise you will be redirected out of the website and not into another tab. -->

<rel> <!--The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and linked document.
          It has many possible values.-->


<type> <!--These attributes known as "type" are attributes that are used in forms. 
This can create boxes, submit boxes, email text etc.-->  

<name> <!--The name attribute is widely used in forms as the name that is used in input fields,
           provides the key in which to pair the users data in the database. For example,
           if a user puts their name in the "name" input databox, "William Toby" then all of the data that this user
          provides will be under the id of "William Toby"-->
         
<textarea> <!--This element gives the user the opportunity to add signifcant amount 
              of text to a textbox. This differs from using an <input element>. 
              It is important to note that <texttarea> has two attributes called <rows> and <cols>
              like <input> elements <textarea> also requires values for name and id attributes.-->

  <required> <!--This is another attribute that is used to make sure that input fields are validated.
  The required attibute acts as a failsafe that denies anybody to put an empty entry. 
It as it's name suggests is a requirement to the user to complete that input field. -->
