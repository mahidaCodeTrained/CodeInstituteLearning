<!--HTML5 is the new version of HTML. It has many semantic web elements and this section of this codespace will help define those. -->
<header> <!--This element in semantic web development, really sets the tone for the webpage or webarticle you write. 
The header element provides introductory content to the webpage and is usuallly defined with nestign a <h1> element inside it.
    It is important to note that <header> is also used in <article> elements as a child element. 
        However, we will touch on this <article> element later on in this section of the codespace.-->

                site navigation or navigation of elements on the same page.-->

                    <a href="#">Contact</a>      <!--This is the <nav> element in full swing. The <a> anchor element creates the clickable links -->
                    <a href="#">Shop</a>         <!--  to other areas of the webpage such as "contact" section or"About" section. -->

<aside> <!--The aside element is generally used for a portion of a document where the text is indirectly related to the main documents content.
It is used in tandem with CSS. -->

<figure> <!--The figure element in semantic HTML5 represents self contained content such as an image, diagram or illustration.
We use the image element to embed the image in an HTML document whereas we use the figure tag to semantically organize the content of an image in the HTML document. 
By placing an image file into a figure element, you are telling the browser and search engines that the content of the figure could be seen on its own, 
separate from the rest of the content of the page, and still make sense.-->
          
                                          <!--The <figure> element has a child element called the <figcaption> element that is used to describe the image in the <figure>
                                            You would use a <figure> where an image is not just decorative but is referred to in an article.-->

<caption> <!--The caption element is used within tables and the <table> element.
            The caption element should be the first child of the table element.-->

<details>&<summary> <!--These semantic HTML5 elements adds a widget to the webpage that can be toggled to open and close.
It can contain information inside the widget.
It usually has an arrow pointing down/sideways to indicate whether or not it's opened or closed.-->

<!--WE WILL NOW COVER ARIA ATTRIBUTES BELOW.-->                                                    

 <ARIA> <!--These aria attributes that will follow this text add extra accessiblity to HTML webpages for visually impaired or audio impaired/physicially impaired users.
            ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications
             and is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.-->

             <!--To provide information about what your links, icons and interactive elements are for,
                 and further detail about how they behave, the aria-label attribute can be applied to them. 
                 The value for an aria-label is a string of text that labels the purpose and behaviour of the element. For example: -->

<a href="https://twitter.com/CodersInstitute" aria-label="Go to our twitter page (opens in new tab)" target="_blank">Twitter</a>

<!--aria-labelledby is another attribute that establishes a relationship between objects and their labels.
The value given to the aria-labelledby attribute should be one or more element IDs, which refer to elements that have the text needed for labelling.-->

<!--For example:...-->
<div aria-labelledby="heading-one heading-two">
    <h1 id="heading-one">First heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text here...</p>
    <h2 id="heading-two">Second heading</h2>
    <p>More paragraph text here...</p>
    </div>

    <meta> <!--The <meta> element in HTML5 semantic makeup is defined in thwe <head> element as a child.
        The meta element allows developers to define important data about their website that will be rendered on display and SEO.-->

        <charset> and <viewport> <!--Charset and Viewport
        
        We use the charset metadata to define the encoding of a website. When we task the meta element to define the character encoding of a website
        , then it uses the charset attribute, the value is usually UTF-8 for Unicode.-->

        <!--However, the viewport metadata type is used to define the viewport - the user's visible area of the web page. 
            This area varies depending on the device, being smaller on a mobile than on a computer screen. 
            This is how the metadata for your viewport should be set on all web pages: -->

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

content="width=device-width" <!--This makes the width of the page follow the width of the screen on whatever device you're viewing it on.-->
initial-scale=1.0" <!--This part of code makes the intial zoom value when you load the page 1.0-->

<meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!--The final three meta keywords we will discuss are description, keywords and author.-->
    <meta name="description" content="Online gallery for abstract painter Joe Blogs">
<meta name="keywords" content="abstract art, painter, paintings, art, artist">
<meta name="author" content="Joe Blogs">
<!--Description describes the webpage when searched, keywords are what are inside the page and the author is who the webpage is about or who created it.-->
