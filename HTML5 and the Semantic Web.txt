We use the image element to embed the image in an HTML document whereas we use the figure tag to semantically organize the content of an image in the HTML document. 
By placing an image file into a figure element, you are telling the browser and search engines that the content of the figure could be seen on its own, 
separate from the rest of the content of the page, and still make sense.-->
          
                                          <!--The <figure> element has a child element called the <figcaption> element that is used to describe the image in the <figure>
                                            You would use a <figure> where an image is not just decorative but is referred to in an article.-->
